# AirbusTinyCopilotSounds

This project provides custom copilot callout sounds for the Airbus series in Microsoft Flight Simulator.

## How to Add Your Own Sounds

1. **Create a Folder:**
	- Inside the `Sounds` directory, create a new folder named after yourself (or your chosen nickname).
	- Example: `Sounds/YourName/`

2. **Naming Convention:**
	- Use the same file names as the default sounds (e.g., `v1.ogg`, `rotate.ogg`, `flaps_1.ogg`, etc.).
	- This ensures compatibility with the app.

3. **File Format:**
	- Sounds must be in `.ogg` format for use in the app.

## Updating Existing Sounds

If you want to update or modify the default sounds:

- The Audacity project file `callouts.aup3` is included for editing the original audio files.
- Open `callouts.aup3` in Audacity, make your changes, and export the updated files in `.ogg` format.
